# Bayesian-Analysis-of-Mobile-Device-User-Behavior-Using-R
This project aims to predict a user's mobile device usage behavior by classifying them into one of two categories: high-frequency or low-frequency users. The analysis utilizes the "Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Dataset" to build and compare two Bayesian regression models for binary classification.
